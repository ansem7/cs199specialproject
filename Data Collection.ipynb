This is done if they are not already in the required format, as the model expects three color channels (red, green, and blue). Aside from converting the images, they are also resized to a standard size of 224x224 pixels. This ensures that all images have the same size and dimensions before being used as the basis of the adversarial images. The images are also then converted to tensors (multi-dimensional arrays) as the model processes them in that form. Lastly, the images are normalized using predefined mean and standard deviation values for each color channel. This ensures that the input values (pixel intensities) have a similar data distribution, making the learning process more efficient.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Du8EHTGkRNxl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **Dataset Sampling**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"qxo1Ya6LPVBV"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### **Sampling Method**\n","\n","This study only used the test folder as it only required a relatively smaller number of images due to previously discussed limitations. To avoid biases, the researchers used random sampling on the fruit and vegetable image dataset. The study used 50 out of 359 test images, which consisted of 25 fruit images and 25 vegetable images. These are stored in two folders (fruits and vegetables). Inside these folders are also folders that contain the test images and are named after the actual classification of the images inside
